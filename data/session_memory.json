{"_default": {"1": {"key": "student_submission", "value": "The ethical theory of rights is based on Hobbes and Locke's reasoning that a government is a social contract for the people. Hobbes believed people trade in their rights or freedoms to be protected by the government, while Locke said the government protects the property of the people. Utilitarianism is based on the greater pleasure or later corrected to benefit given to the most people being a guide for justifying actions. Utilitarianism is more ethical and practical compared to the rights theory, as positive rights would usually be considered lesser than negative rights, while Utilitarianism focuses on bringing greater benefit through the government providing for positive rights rather than worrying about violating negative rights. They are incompatible as rights theory has no qualms with taking away the rights of criminals while utilitarianism considers all parties that would suffer or benefit. The surveillance of criminals encounters a problem when finding justification for doing so, this loophole is mitigated by weighing the benefit of finding criminals versus potential data leaks. This logic seems to have been implemented today with how monitored online activity is, but that could be a surface-level reason for financial gain, such as Meta using user data for targeted advertisements against user consent. This doesn't fall into utilitarianism strictly, but this issue aligns both concerns over rights and welfare by invading the nebulous concept of privacy and having real consequences for the data leaks. Another example would be the genocide in Gaza, while there isn't a violation of negative rights for the American population, positive rights of providing welfare to the American population in need are impeded due to the diversion of federal funds to Israeli military. Considering the harm that American tax dollars is funding, Utilitarians would weigh those lives lost and Palestinians who are suffering and consider the benefit the money could be used for, such as eliminating student debt or helping the homeless. Rights theory isn't in line with ethics as it doesn't consider general injustice to be a big concern due to weighing it in regards to the American population. The sentiment of doing it the supposed right way in regards to college tuition or immigration becomes null as these feelings won't be counted for Utilitarianism, not even counting how difficult it is to pay college loans or getting a green card as laid out by the government's laws. However, in rights theory, these feelings won't be accounted for, but the people who illegally came to the United States might be subject to a loss of rights in the eyes of the state, which can be seen in ICE deportation. However, they did not impede anyone's negative rights, so they have no crime according to rights ethics but are seen as criminals due to the law. Utilitarianism would think about the benefits of immigrants receiving public aid versus the horrible camps and opt in favor of them staying as citizens to prevent unnecessary harm."}, "2": {"key": "student_replies_to_others", "value": "Hello Michael,\n\nI agree that when rights theory and utilitarianism's goals are aligned, it can lead to an acceptable result. However, what would be the next best alternative in the case of the Covid-19 pandemic you mentioned? It was mentioned that privacy is seen as a vague concern, so a vague negative right such as autonomy needs to have listed harmful consequences if violated. Feelings of frustration toward masking in a minority would be treated as inconsequential compared to the benefit of mitigating the spread and death toll of a deadly disease for the entire population.\n"}, "3": {"key": "structure_grade", "value": "100"}, "4": {"key": "engagement_grade", "value": "100"}, "5": {"key": "referencing_grade", "value": "50"}, "6": {"key": "total_grade", "value": "95"}, "7": {"key": "rounded_grade", "value": "100"}, "8": {"key": "feedback", "value": "You clearly explained complex theories well."}, "9": {"key": "message_history", "value": "[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"try telling the tool \\\"fetch data about cs students\\\" as the input arg. leave order blank\"}, {\"role\": \"agent\", \"content\": \"It seems that there is no more data available regarding CS students.
